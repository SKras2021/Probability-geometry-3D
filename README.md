Information on the programm

What is it?
This program is intended to demonstrate the development of independent structures in the system which only follows the law of complete chaos. It is accomplished by representing the structure as a matrix of cubes - positioned in space in a way that the most efficient display is avaliable. Rotation on all of the 3 axis, scaling - all using just a regular mouse. This program is capable of creating wounderous new wourlds for you to explore. From the simple unlucky shapes which met their ultimate demise from bumping into themselfs all the way to complex biological patterns visible with more detalied shapes. This program offers you a universe in which you are the creator and observer at the same time. You are the one setting boundaies, but noone will know how the product will look in the end, until it is done. And perhaps the most fasicating thing about the project is the shocking simplicity of the core - in Famous game "Convay game of life" which at it's time turned the perception of chaos upide down and innovated the concept of 0 player games, there were 4 rules. And in this simulation there is only one. Spread chaoticaly where you can until there is not space to go. (Or until the user commands otherwise, if you want to see only part of the picture and dissect the life at it's birth).
